This repository is for my embedded systems development training.

Here you will find my exercices and projects using different development boards.

My first one is the Texas Instruments TM4C123G Tiva C Series Launchpad that I use for Bare metal C programming while I'm
taking this Udemy's course: https://www.udemy.com/course/bare-metal-embedded-c-programming-tm4c123/.

I'll be constantly updating this repository while I'm learning about embedded systems.

Feel free to contact me by e-mail if you wish to talk about embedded systems and other tech trends: paulohsantosol@gmail.com.
